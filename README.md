# untitled_puzzle_game
(name will be changed eventually of course)

just a personal project for a vs puzzle game (think the same genre as puyo puyo and the like)

the goal is to have a functional "story mode" with opponent AI and everything, but that's a long way away

todo:
- real menuing (frankly i just need to sit down and do it)
- real graphics (i am not an artist!!!)
- figure out exactly how i want to handle sending garbage (right now it's set up to be random; i have a cooler idea, but i need to work out some fundamental issues with it....)
- multiple players at once (probably need to do some refactoring...)
- opponent AI
